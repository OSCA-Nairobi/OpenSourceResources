## What is Open Source?

Let's address the elephant in the room that is _“What is Open-Source?”_.

Open-source software is a type of software that is publicly accessible and allows anyone to view, modify, and distribute the source code.

"Open-source software is made by many people and distributed under an OSD-compliant license which grants all the rights to use, study, change and share the software is modified and unmodified form. Software freedom is essential to enabling community development of open-source software."

-Opensource.org

Open Source Software is not only free but also lets you access its source code. They let you understand the code. You can use the code in your project, can edit the project, and after editing, can distribute under a different license.

Is Open-source software really free? Well this entirely depends on the software you are using. Nearly all open source software is free except for a few. This is majorly determined by the restrictveness of the license.

If a project is open-source, other developers can contribute to it through platforms like GitHub(I will discuss GitHub in a later part) or GitLab. The idea of helping other developer’s projects is forming an open-source community. This community is growing, helping, and impacting the development of software.
Two words most commonly attached to the open-source community are Git and GitHub. Let’s look at these.

## Open Source Community

Now that you have an understanding of what Open Source is, let's look at the Open Source Community.

Open-source community is a community of developers who are working on open-source projects. The community is a group of people who are working on these projects. They are helping each other in developing the projects, and helping the community grow by learning new technologies and skills.

We have a ton of such communities on the internet. Some of the most popular ones are:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/)
- [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/)
- [Discord](https://discord.com/)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/)
- [Dev.to](https://dev.to/)
- [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/)

## Git

Suppose you are working in a group of developers on a single project. There is an original project file (let's called it master). Each developer has a duplicate copy of the master, and everyone is working on different features. After each developer has completed his work, it's time to add the source code to the master.

If everyone adds the code to master without knowing each other’s code, then there can be an issue such as

Different structure of code.

Some features will work, and some won’t.

Create complexity in the source code.

If the code isn't backup, then it will hard to roll back changes.

To solve such a problem, Git comes to rescue the developers.

Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
-Git

In Git, version control tracks down every change in any file, which can be easily pushed to master. Since every change is tracked down, it becomes easy to go back to the previous code if there is a bug in the new code; otherwise, there will be a lot of trouble in manually removing code, making it compatible with the previous code again.

With the help of Git, every developer can work on a different branch and, after approval, can merge into master.

## GitHub

Git provides control over the source code, and GitHub is a platform which uses git version control to upload open source project to theirs cloud for sharing code to others. Git is local, and GitHub is cloud-based.

GitHub as a platform has helped developers in many ways, such as

Sharing code with other developers.

Collaborating with other developers around the world.

Discussing ideas and features for the project.

Other people can report an issue.

Some developers can work on the issue.

And Many More.

> **Note:** Git and GitHub are not the same thing. Git is a tool, and GitHub is a service for projects that use Git.

## GitLab

GitLab is a platform similar to GitHub. It is also a cloud-based platform that uses Git version control. It is also open-source and free to use and used by many developers around the world.

Similart to GitHub, GitLab also provides many features such as distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.

## How to Contribute to Open Source?

Now that you have a basic understanding of what open-source is, let's look at how you can contribute to open-source.

### 1. Find a Project to Contribute

The first step is to find a project to contribute. There are many ways to find a project to contribute. Some of them are:

- [GitHub Explore](https://github.com/explore)
- [Up For Grabs](https://up-for-grabs.net/)
- [First Timers Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/)
- [CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com/)
- [24 Pull Requests](https://24pullrequests.com/)
- [Your First PR](https://yourfirstpr.github.io/)
- [Contributor-ninja](https://contributor.ninja/)
- [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)
- [Open Source Friday](https://opensourcefriday.com/)

### 2. Find an Issue to Work On

After finding a project, the next step is to find an issue to work on. There are many ways to find an issue to work on. Some of them are:

### 3. Fork the Project

After finding a project and an issue to work on, the next step is to fork the project. Forking a project means creating a copy of the project on your GitHub account. This copy is called a fork. You can make changes to the forked project without affecting the original project.

### 4. Clone the Project

After forking the project, the next step is to clone the project. Cloning a project means creating a local copy of the project on your computer. This copy is called a clone. You can make changes to the cloned project without affecting the original project.

### 5. Create a Branch

After cloning the project, the next step is to create a branch. Creating a branch means creating a copy of the master branch. This copy is called a branch. You can make changes to the branch without affecting the master branch.

### 6. Make Changes

After creating a branch, the next step is to make changes. Making changes means making changes to the code.

You can make changes to the code in any text editor. Some of the popular text editors are: VS Code, Atom, Sublime Text, etc. You can also use an IDE(Integrated Development Environment) such as PyCharm, Eclipse, etc. to make changes to the code.

### 7. Commit Changes

After making changes, the next step is to commit changes. Committing changes means saving the changes to the local repository.

### 8. Push changes to GitHub

After committing changes, the next step is to push changes to GitHub. Pushing changes means saving the changes to the remote repository.

### 9. Create a Pull Request

After pushing changes to GitHub, the next step is to create a pull request. Creating a pull request means creating a pull request to the original project.

### 10. Get your Pull Request Merged

After creating a pull request, the next step is to get your pull request merged. Getting your pull request merged means getting your pull request merged to the original project.
